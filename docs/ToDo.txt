* Generate documentation for the standard validators.

* Make a test fixture for validators, to make testing really easy.

* Consider moving htmlfill to ElementTree or another DOM-ish
  structure, instead of HTMLParser.

* Generate Javascript for validators, for client-side validation (when
  possible).

* At least test and give recipes for Ajax-ish validation, when fully
  client-side validation doesn't work.  (Client side is more
  interesting to me, though -- Ajax still does a server query, and
  isn't much better than a full submit)

* Better tests for ``htmlfill`` and ``htmlfill_schemabuilder``.

* Create a ``RequireIfNotEmpty`` form validator, when one field is
  only required when another is filled in.

* Include at least one good documented form generator.  Consider
  including rich widgets (Javascript).

* Figure out what the role of ``htmlform`` is.

* Seperate out ``doctest_xml_compare``, maybe (useful in any doctested
  web test).

* Make ``doctest_xml_compare`` work with wildcards/ellipses.  Maybe
  with non-XHTML.

* Figure out how the heck to get this to scale to really small forms.
  Does it make any sense there?  When does it start making sense to
  use FormEncode?

* Some more ways to build validation.  Validation from docstrings or
  method signatures.
